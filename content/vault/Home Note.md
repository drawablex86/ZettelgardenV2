Hey, Home note is were I try to keep things more or less organised. Here, I have created some entry points intro different topics and thoughts deliberately. It serves as a meta-index page to all notes in this personal knowledge management system. Do note that the home note will undergo changes with time, as I consume new information and change how I think about organsing the mental model of my digital garden.

## Topic wise entry points

-   [[ Design System ]] - Inception, definition, future of Design systems
-   [Zettelkasten](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/zettelkasten) - Comprehension, digital vs analogue, personalisation
-   [Productivity](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/productivity) - Mindsets, Process, Approaches, End Game
-   [Mental Models](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/mental-models) - Dissecting the classic mental models for my own comprehension
-   [Writing](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/writing) - Content, Copy, Persuasion, Strategy, Communication
-   [Learning](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/learning) - Science, Methods and Optimisaitons
-   [[ Knowledge Management ]] - Information overload, how to manage information

I would like to add topics such as art, design, thinking, cognition, business, process, marketing, communication, intelligence, coding and decision making as I expand my reading and exposure to information.

All notes ([Orphan Notes](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/orphan-notes)) that are yet to have assigned any starting points or topics can be found in the [Budding Ground](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/budding-ground). You might also find my [Book](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/book) record interesting; these have helped me significantly shape my approach to living a life that promotes creation over consumption. I am also compiling a list of [Evergreen Articles](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/evergreen-articles) and [People](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/people) who have influenced me directly or indirectly.

Finally, let me remind you that Zettelgarden is my pet project. I am trying to create a public version of my personal knowledge management system through a combination of various approaches that are followed by some of the most amazing people that I know through internet. The core motivation for this project remains the [Zettelkasten](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/zettelkasten) system, I am constantly adopting the make up of this system to suit my own needs. I try to keep a [Change Log](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/change-log) for the site, so that I can document serious mindshift changes and work flow adaptations.

Of late, I am also thinking of framing my own [12 favourite problems](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/12-favourite-problems) like Richard Feynman.
